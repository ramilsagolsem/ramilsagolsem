# Hello There!
#### Thank you for visiting at part of my world! <img alt="Love you gif" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/TamGVAGxDTYDNt3dpn/giphy.gif" width="48" />

I'm Ramil Sagolsem, a Software Enthusiast working for a Telecom Software Solution Provider! I'm from the [Kangleipak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur_(princely_state)) and currently in Brazil exploring the sunshine since 2014. I love Android and mobile development and I'm currently developing my currency converter app [Exploratu](https://github.com/izadiegizabal/exploratu/) that uses OCR to show the conversions directly in the camera! :airplane:	:euro: :camera_flash:

I'm also obsessed with Shiba-Inu, yes, equally important.
